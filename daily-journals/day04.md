# Day 03 – [30/05/2025]

**Time Spent:** 5 hours

## 🧠 What I Did:
- Completed TryHackMe modules: `Search Skills`, `Active Directory Basics`
- Started development on custom IOC extractor tool in Python

## ⚙️ Tools Used:
- Kali Linux, Wireshark, GitHub, TryHackMe, Python3, Active Directory

## 🧩 Challenges:
- Mental fatigue and energy dip (expected, considering real-life priorities)
- First-time building a CLI tool with full read/write handling, regex, and logic flow

## 💡 Learnings:
- A *Security Principal* is any object that can request access to resources (users, groups, computers, etc.)
- Learned basic domain controller management: creating OUs, groups, and user permissions
- Practiced safe regex parsing and file IO handling in Python

## 🧾 Artifacts Created:
- IOC Extractor tool scaffold: `Tools/IOC Extractor/IOCExtractor.py`
- Regex IP extraction setup in progress

## 📌 Plan for Tomorrow:
- Implement IP extraction and write output to `results.txt`
- Begin extracting domain names from alert logs
- Continue Active Directory exploration (privilege escalation scenarios or delegation)
